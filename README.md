# Mathematical-Modeling-Assignment-201
 Mathematical Modeling Assignment from term 201, Ho Chi Minh University of Technology. This assignment is about simulating a dynamical system, which is the micro-climate in a Greenhouse.
 
 In this project, most research about Greenhouse climate's dynamical system is referenced from PhD thesis of B.H.E. Vanthoor entitled: ***A model-based greenhouse design method***.

 Datasets used in the project for running simualtion and validating results.
 Data used in this project is obtained from Sonoma team (**Greenhouse_climate.csv**, **vip.csv**) and weather station data (**meteo.csv**)

 Python code for simulations, CO2 and Vapour Pressure models are divided into 2 section for easy-to-implement and easy-to-understand purpose. Both use the two algorithms **Explicit Euler** and **Runge-Kutta 4<sup>th</sup>**.

>report 

Report for the whole project in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5CLaTeX" />, including our knowledge about **Differential equations** and **Explicit Euler** as well as **Runge-Kutta 4<sup>th</sup>** algorithms.

>topic

The topic of the assignment, handed out by Mr.Nguyen Tien Thinh and Mr.Nguyen An Khuong.
