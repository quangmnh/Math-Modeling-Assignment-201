 Datasets used in the project for running simualtion and validate results.
 Data used in this project is obtained from Sonoma team (**Greenhouse_cliamte.csv**, **vip.csv**) and weather station data (**meteo.csv**)

 Python code for simulations, CO2 and Vapour Pressure models are divided into 2 section for easy-to-implement and easy-to-understand purpose. Both use the two algorithms Explicit Euler and Runge-Kutta 4<sup>th</sup>
